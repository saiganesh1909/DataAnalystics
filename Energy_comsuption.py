# # so we are using theory called bmi
# The amount of energy (or calories) burned while sleeping varies by age, weight, and sex, primarily because basal metabolic rate (BMR) differs among individuals. BMR is the rate at which your body uses energy while at rest to maintain vital functions such as breathing, circulating blood, and cell production. Generally, your body burns fewer calories when you're sleeping than when you're awake and active, but it does continue to burn calories at a rate influenced by your BMR.
# 
# Calculating the exact energy expenditure during sleep can be complex because it depends on the individual's specific characteristics. However, a rough estimate can be made using the formula for BMR and adjusting for the sleeping state.
# 
# For men: BMR = 10 * weight (kg) + 6.25 * height (cm) - 5 * age (y) + 5
# 
# For women: BMR = 10 * weight (kg) + 6.25 * height (cm) - 5 * age (y) - 161
# 
# so according to this we have to caluclate the data

# Pancakes with syrup (United States): About 520 calories for three medium pancakes with 2 tablespoons of maple syrup.
# Congee with pickled vegetables (China): Approximately 200-250 calories for a medium bowl of congee and a small serving of pickled vegetables.
# Miso soup with rice (Japan): Around 200 calories for one medium bowl of miso soup and a half-cup of cooked rice.
# Bread with sausage and cheese (Germany): Approximately 500-600 calories for a medium serving, depending on the amount of cheese and sausage.
# Masala dosa with sambar (India): About 400 calories for one medium masala dosa and a serving of sambar.
# Full English breakfast (United Kingdom): Around 800-1000 calories for a medium serving including eggs, bacon, sausages, beans, toast, and tomatoes.
# Croissant with coffee (France): Approximately 300 calories for a medium butter croissant, not including the coffee. If you add sugar or cream to the coffee, remember to add those calories as well.
# P達o de queijo with coffee (Brazil): Around 300 calories for three medium-sized p達o de queijo and a black coffee without sugar.
# Cappuccino with cornetto (Italy): About 250-300 calories for a medium cappuccino and a medium cornetto (Italian croissant).
# Maple syrup on pancakes (Canada): This is similar to the first item, but if considering just the maple syrup, about 52 calories per tablespoon. For three pancakes, it's about 520 calories plus the syrup.
